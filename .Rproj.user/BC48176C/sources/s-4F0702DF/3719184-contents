Modelling Root Lesion Nematode Population Densities
================



This repository contains the Rmd file for the “Fitting Linear and
Quadratic Models of Nematode Population Responses to Time and
Temperature”, which is posted to Open Plant Pathology as a teaching note
on 02/2018.

The [Fitting\_Nematode\_Models.Rmd](Fitting_Nematode_Models.Rmd) file
contains the markdown, which was reviewed by
[@emdelponte](https://github.com/emdelponte) and
[@mladencucak](https://github.com/emdelponte)
to generate the content of the blog post.
